I've developed a dynamic Real Estate website utilizing a tech stack comprising Django, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with PostgreSQL serving as the robust database backend. 
The website empowers users to seamlessly explore real estate properties, get in touch with real estate professionals, and inquire about specific properties. 
It offers key sections such as the home page, an about section, a feature listing page, and user registration and login functionalities.
The site's user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience, while my deployment of this project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development and a commitment to advancing real estate technology.
